intro

step1: 50 DNS names -> resolve to IPs with RIPE Atlas probe resolvers
   -> TODO: help with abuf (stephane bortzmeyer tools?)

step2: you cannot trace towards all these IPs
   -> what strategy to use to reduce, where you can argue you won't loose measurement accuracy
   -> thought exercise -> not coding per-se
   
step3: traceroutes from probes towards the target IPs   goal: use APIs or UI, discover parameters
   -> probe selection?  easiest: ask atlas for 1000 probes
      -> one probe per AS + country? other selection strategies?
   -> traceroute parameters -> discussion
   -> split up the list of IPs and give groups different parts of that list

(measurements take 10 mins, some discussion here. TODO)

step4: analysing the traceroutes.  goal: use API to download results, parse ripe atlas data (raw json, or use cousteau)
   -> how many source ASNs and how many countries in the results?
   -> TODO anything simple to extract from the traceroutes
   -> just discuss the concepts?

end result: run quirin's script and compare to results in the paper?
