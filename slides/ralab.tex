\textbf{RQ: How many networks do you need eavesdropping capabilities to surveil a majority of APNs backend logins?}

Steps to be taken:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the backend servers?
	\item How to measure user population connecting to backend servers?
	\item How to map this to networks? What is a network in this context?
\end{itemize}

\framesubtitle{}

From passive observations at 1 Vantage Point (VP), we know that clients resolve [1-50]-courier.push.apple.com and then connect to 1 IP address in the 17/8 range.

How to find all APNs backend servers?
\pause

\textbf{Task: Pick 1 of `[1-50]-courier.push.apple.com` and do a RIPE Atlas DNS resolution for your home country}

Example: 42-courier.push.apple.com

Note: More experienced Ripe Atlas users are invited to do resolutions for all 50 DNS names.

\frametitle{Step 2: Traceroute Path Measurements}
\framesubtitle{}
Our DNS queries have yielded a list of backend servers. Coming back to our Research Question, we want to quantify the number of networks an adversary has to eavesdrop on to see a significant number of logins directed to those backend servers. \\
\textbf{Task: Define and execute a measurement strategy: Which RIPE Atlas settings? Which probes? Which targets?}\\
Note: Again, Ripe Atlas novices can just run measurements towards 1 target IP address.

\pause
\textbf{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Traceroute Details -- \url{https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/form/}
	\item Target Selection -- all IP addresses? Some? 
	\item Probe Selection -- which probes to select? Do these represent the APNs user base
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which probes to select?
		\item Do they represent the APNs user base? AS/CC bias?
		\item Only probes that resolved the IP being probed?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item JSON -- Ripe Atlas Cousteau or raw JSON parsing
	\item Next step: Map to IXPs and ASes -- Ideas on data sources?
\end{itemize}
\pause
Fortunately, the link \url{https://github.com/tumi8/cca-privacy/tree/master/ripe_atlas/traceroute} contains the script ``traceroutes\_to\_asn\_ixp.py.''

	Research Question: How many networks does an attacker have to eavesdrop on to observe a significant share of APNs logins?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We identify APNs backend infrastructure and conduct distributed traceroute \\ measurements towards it
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Measurements confirm that clients resolve one of \textit{[1-50]-courier.push.apple.com}
		\item We globally resolve \textit{[1-50]-courier.push.apple.com} using 1000 Ripe Atlas probes each
		\item We find 69 /24 subnets and pick one random observed IP address in each of the 69 subnets
		\item Using 1000 Ripe Atlas probes per measurement, we conduct traceroute measurements towards all 69 IP addresses
		\end{itemize}
		\item We map transit router's IP addresses to ISPs and IXPs 
		%\begin{itemize}
		%	\item Pitfall: Control for Ripe Atlas probes' home AS!
		%\end{itemize}
		\item We count what \% of routes traverses a certain ISP or IXP
